Hello professor and TAs, my name is Xingyao Wu. This is my last semester studying as a undergraduate student in Northeastern University.

My major is Computer Engineering and minor is Computer Science. I have done coops in Lenovo and IBM as Android operating system tester and
front-end software engineer intern. I have done a brunch of projects in web developing like photo-based social network, Jenkins builds/BVT
dashboards based on AngularJS in IBM and testbed status dashboard also in IBM.

The propose of this repo is to update my code that I will be working on during this course.
